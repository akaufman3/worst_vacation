Plan your worst vacation with us!

Rent horrible places to stay from sketchy hosts in hipster cities. Whether a basement closet for a night, a "cozy nook" for a week, or a kitchen corner for a month, Worst Vacation connects people to unique travel experiences, at rediculous price points, in only 52 cities and one, maybe two, countries. And lets be real, with sub-par customer service and a questionable community of users, Worst Vacation is the easiest way for people to monetize their extra space and attract an audience of millions with questionable motives.

A parody vacation booking site built in a week. A rake task scrapes the site Worst Room for content while a cron job updates the data bi-weekly.
